## Label Processing Tool Guide
This tools are designed for processing labels and converting them into COCO JSON format suitable for Adelaidet, to be used for training text spotting models. This format includes interpolation of BÃ©zier curves and conversion of text indices. The entire process is divided into three main steps:

### Step 1: Convert on-site labels
Script Name: convert_unitsdet_json_onsite.py
Description: This script extracts labels from on-site and generates labels in a format compatible with MMOCR. It scans the annotator-labeled directory labels/v1.0.0 and combines them with the labels generated by UNITS in images_unit_shared_quad_txts.

### Step 2: Generate COCO JSON format labels
Script Name: convert2coco.py
Description: This script converts labels from the MMOCR format to the Adelaidet COCO JSON format for text spotting. It is important to note that this label format distinguishes between versions containing 37 and 96 character indices. Typically, ABCNet supports the 96-character label set, while DeepSolo can handle both 37 and 96 characters.

### Step 3: Visualize labels
Script Name: vis_coco_gt.py
Description: Running this script visualizes the generated labels to ensure their accuracy.

### Usage Instructions
Follow the steps in order to ensure that the output from each stage correctly serves as the input for the next. For detailed usage of each script, refer to the respective help documentation or built-in instructions.
